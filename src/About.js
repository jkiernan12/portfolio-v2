        <h4 className='experience--title'>My Story</h4>
          <p>In my previous positions, I worked in digital and print content creation, project management, and digital marketing. I became the go-to person whenever coworkers ran into technical obstacles or when managers wanted to implement new technologies and software. I had the opportunity to learn good ol' fashioned HTML and CSS and implement it to create and enhance marketing channels. </p>

          <p>I self-taught with lessons from the Odin Project, uDemy, and freeCodeCamp. In 2021, I realized programming was something I wanted to pursue fulltime, and I joined the <a href="https://turing.edu/
          ">Turing School of Software & Design</a>.</p>
          <p>It has been an amazing experience. I've learned a lot of technical skills, but also soft skills in terms of teamwork in a technical environment, the Agile methodology/workflow, and challenges in the larger software development ecosystem.</p>

        <h4>Here's what I'm into:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Rock Climbing: DEFINITELY my biggest hobby. When not climbing indoors, I climb in Connecticut and New Hampshire. You can check out some of my climbing ticks and to-dos on <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/user/200928904/john-kiernan">Mountain Project</a></li>
          <li>Homebrewing/craft beer: I've been homebrewing for five years. My current fascination is European-style sour beers (here's <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/641/1745/">one of my favorites</a>). Currently I have an oude bruin in the fermenter that should be ready in... oh maybe another year or so?</li>
          <li>Longboarding: I picked up a couple of boards this past summer and have been cruising around on my local bike path ever since. No tricks or bombing downhill just yet, just tootling around.</li>
          <li>Travel: Sadly more of a pre-Covid hobby -- I managed to get to Germany, Spain and Italy in the last couple of years. I would love to get out to Japan and Australia/New Zealand sometime in the next few years.</li>
          <li>Watery adventures: Sailing, snorkeling ans scuba diving üê†üåä‚õµÔ∏è</li>
